RF-BM-ND04 is an RF module based on Nordic BLE SoC nRF52832 with ARM® Cortex®-M4 32-bit processor. It
integrates a 32.768 kHz and a 32 MHz crystal, an LC filter, an antenna matching, and a meander line inverted-F PCB
antenna or the IPEX connector respectively. It supports BLE stack v5.0 including the high-speed 2 Mbps feature and
can be preprogrammed with serial interface communication protocols, such as NFC, ANT and 2.4 GHz proprietary for
simple programming. RF-BM-ND04 also supports Bluetooth mesh which can be run concurrently with Bluetooth LE,
enabling smartphones to provision, commission, configure and control mesh nodes. The module has NFC-A Tag for use
in simplified pairing and payment solutions. It has numerous digital peripherals and interfaces such as ADC, PDM, PWM,
I2C and I2S for many applications. It features low power consumption, small size, robust connection distance, and rigid
reliability. 1.27-mm pitch stamp stick package for easy assembling and cost-effective PCB design.
